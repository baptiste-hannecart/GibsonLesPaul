 	 	     <h2>1952 Gibson Les Paul</h2>
 	 	     <img src="images/1952LP.jpg" alt="1952 Gibson Les Paul">
 	 	     <p>The Les Paul that started it all. The original Les Paul model was designed by Gibson in response to the growing popularity of the Fender Telecaster. Upon its introduction, the new model sported a pair of single-coil P-90 pickups, a clumsy trapeze tailpiece, and a Mahogany slab body with a curved Maple top. Les Paul himself endorsed a solid gold finish to make the guitar appear high-end and luxurious</p>

 	 	     <h2>1953 Gibson Les Paul</h2>
 	 	     <img src="images/1953LP.jpg" alt="1953 Gibson Les Paul">
 	 	     <p>While Les Paul was a well-known innovator often credited with the development of the solidbody guitar itself, his contribution to the new model remains controversial. He did have some say in the selection of woods as well as the flimsy trapeze bridge, though most of the actual design was spearheaded by Gibson chief, Ted McCarty. By early 1953, a new combination bridge-tailpiece replaced the original trapeze design</p>

 	 	     <h2>1954 Gibson Les Paul</h2>
 	 	     <img src="images/1954LP.jpg" alt="1954 Gibson Les Paul">
 	 	     <p>In conjunction with the evolution of the tailpiece, Gibson's engineers also gradually increased the depth of Les Paul's neck angle. This change improved the action of the instrument by allowing easier adjustment of the bridge. By 1954, Gibson had expanded the Les Paul line with the student-level Les Paul Junior and the top-of-the-line Les Paul Custom. The 1954 Gibson Les Pauls are considered to be better than those of 1953 because the construction process is better mastered than in 1953</p>

 	 	     <h2>1955 Gibson Les Paul Custom</h2>
 	 	     <img src="images/1955LPC.jpg" alt="1955 Gibson Les Paul Custom">
 	 	     <p>Like the Goldtop, the Les Paul Custom's tuxedo-like cosmetics were meant to look high-end, earning this model the nickname Black Beauty. The Custom differed from the Standard in its use of multi-ply binding, square inlays on an Ebony fingerboard, gold-plated parts and comparatively low frets.This model was the first to use the new stopbar tailpiece and tune-o-matic bridge, an innovation closely associated with Ted McCarty which was added to the standard in 1955</p>

 	 	     <h2>1957 Gibson Les Paul</h2>
 	 	     <img src="images/1957LP.jpg" alt="1957 Gibson Les Paul">
 	 	     <p>The introduction of the stopbar tailpiece and tune-o-matic bridge brought the Les Paul close to the format of the modern Les Paul. The addition of the Seth Lover-designed "Patent Applied For," or PAF, humbuckers of 1957 elevated the Les Paul to a status of all-time icon. By connecting two pickup coils in series and out-of-phase, Lover and Gibson sought to combat the common 60-cycle hum of conventional pickups. This innovation also fostered a beefier new tone that would be embraced by rock musicians for decades to come</p>

 	 	     <h2>1960 Gibson Les Paul Custom</h2>
 	 	     <img src="images/1960LPC.jpg" alt="1960 Gibson Les Paul Custom">
 	 	     <p>Like the Les Paul Standard, the Les Paul Custom received the humbucker makeover in 1957. The Custom, however, packed three humbuckers instead of two (though some examples maintained the traditional two pickup configuration). In 1957, Gibson switched from Kluson tuners to Grover Rotomatics for the Custom. It's mainly keith richards, the guitarist of the roling stones who made this model famous</p>

 	 	     <h2>1960 Gibson Les Paul</h2>
 	 	     <img src="images/1960LP.jpg" alt="1960 Gibson Les Paul">
 	 	     <p>In the fall of 1958, Gibson abandoned the original Goldtop finish in favor of a new Cherry Sunburst. The "Burst" Les Pauls of 1959 to late 1960 remain atop the list of the most collectible guitars ever made. The 1960 model, in particular, is known for having a slimmer neck, leading many modern Gibson models to either replicate the slim '60s neck profile or the fatter '50s neck profile</p>
